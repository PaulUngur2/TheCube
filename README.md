# TheCube
The Cube is a fun side-scrolling game where you control a cube who jumps infinitely through the game world. Your goal is to avoid hitting the red blocks by pressing space.

The game is made primarily using JavaScript, with HTML and CSS for the user interface. It features a simple control scheme, where you use the space key to jump.
